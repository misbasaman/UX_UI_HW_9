        <h3>Wireframing and Prototyping</h3>
        <p>Wireframing is a low-fidelity visual representation of a design's layout and structure. Prototyping creates interactive, high-fidelity versions of the design, allowing user interaction for validation and feedback. Combining wireframing and prototyping streamlines development and ensures user needs are met.</p>
